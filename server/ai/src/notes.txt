Image augmentation - randomnly generates training images by flipping, rotating, shifting or doing a series of such operation on images.

CONTRAST STRETCHING: Adjust contrast of the image (rescales intensity values)

HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION: increase global contrast of img using the image intensity historgam. Sometimes results in unnatural looking imgs.

Good image as pixel values from all range (not just high or low). SO stretch image. MAKES ALL IMAGES TO SAME LIGHTING CONDITIONS.

FROM CNTK TUTORIALS:
model_factory() : all the CNN layers
model = model_factory()
x = cntk.input_variable(input_shape)
y = cntk.input_variable(num_classes, is_sparse=True)

The criterion function is used by the trainer to optimize the model: 
It maps (input vectors, labels) to (loss, metric). The loss is used for the SGD updates.
We choose cross entropy. Specifically, cross_entropy_with_softmax() first applies the softmax() to the network’s output, 
as cross entropy expects probabilities. 
We do not include softmax() in the model function itself, because it is not necessary for using the model. 
As the metric, we count classification errors (this metric is not differentiable).

def criterion_model_factory(data, label_one_hot):
    z = model(data)
    loss = cntk.cross_entropy_with_softmax(z, label_one_hot)
    metric = cntk.classification_error(z, label_one_hot)
    return loss, metric
criterion_model = criterion_model_factory(x,y)
throw momentum

learner = cntk.sgd(model_lr.parameters,
                   cntk.learning_parameter_schedule(0.1))
progress_writer = cntk.logging.ProgressPrinter(0)

criterion_lr.train((X_train_lr, Y_train_lr), parameter_learners=[learner],
                   callbacks=[progress_writer])

the learner is the object that actually performs the model update. 
Alternative learners include momentum_sgd() and adam()
The train() function is feeding our data (X_train_lr, Y_train_lr) minibatch by minibatch to the model and updates it
